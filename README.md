# UN-SPIDER
UN-SPIDER is a programme of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), with offices in Vienna, Beijing and Bonn. On its Knowledge Portal, the programme systematically compiles relevant information on how to use Earth observation, satellite communication and satellite navigation for disaster risk management and emergency response. Through workshops, technical advisory support and training courses, UN-SPIDER facilitates knowledge exchange and capacity building on how to access and use space-based information, especially in developing countries.

# Recommended Practices
When using space technologies for disaster risk management and emergency response, it is not only important to have access to the right data and software, it is also crucial to be aware of practices that have proven effective in a specific context.

UN-SPIDER is working together with partners and Regional Support Offices to provide practical insight and hands-on instructions, so-called Recommended Practices, on how to use satellite information for various hazards, in various phases of the disaster management cycle.

# Drought monitoring  
Drought monitoring is an important component in drought early warning systems. These Recommended Practices show how to monitor the impacts of meteorological drought on natural vegetation using MODIS optical satellite imagery.

The Recommended Practice using [the Standard Vegetation Index (SVI)](http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-drought-monitoring-using-standard) was developed by the Universidad Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM) in Brazil in the context of the ["Strengthening Early Warning Systems - Drought" (SEWS-D)](http://www.un-spider.org/projects/SEWS-D-project-caribbean) project in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is available in both R and Python.

The Recommended Practice using [the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)](http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-agricultural-drought-monitoring) was developed by the Iranian Space Agency. It is available in Envi (5 and 4.8), R and Python.
